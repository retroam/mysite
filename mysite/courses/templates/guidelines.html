<section id="participation">
<h3><span class="title">Participation</span></h3>
<p>You are expected to <strong>attend class</strong> and
<strong>actively participate in (but not dominate) class
discussions</strong>. Beyond that baseline, there are are two other
ways you are required to participate:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Leading discussion of readings.</strong> During the
  semester each student in the class must volunteer to lead discussion
  of at least one assigned reading. When it is your turn to lead
  discussion, please come up with 2-3 good discussion questions
  pertaining to the reading, and post them on the class Web site
  (instructions on how to do this coming soon). You must post your
  questions prior to the beginning of class. In class, you will be
  expected to kick off the discussion by asking your questions and
  opening the floor for discussion.</li>
  <li><strong>Blogging and commenting.</strong> We will have a class
  blog, and you are expected to post and comment there throughout the
  semester. Consider blogging an opportunity to think out loud and
  share ideas and insights you've had with your classmates. Blogging
  will also help you to see the concepts we’re introducing in this
  class out in the real world, helping you better understand the
  material. Great topics for great blog posts include news stories
  relating to issues we've discussed in class; questions or comments
  relating to lectures; a story about something related to information
  organization that happened to you; or reflections on things you’ve
  learned.  I want this to be an open and fun place for discussion
  that will help enrich your conceptual understanding of the
  course.</li>
</ol>

<section id="honor">
<h3><span class="title">Honor Code</span></h3>
<p>Collaboration, discussion, and seeking assistance from other
students is encouraged in this class and is not inconsistent with the
<a href="http://honor.unc.edu/">Honor Code</a>. In the case of written
work, all words drawn from others must be attributed
appropriately.</p>
